abstract = "A polynomial $f(x)$ has emergent reducibility at depth $n$ if $f^{\\circ k}(x)$ is irreducible for $0 \\leq k \\leq n − 1$ but $f^{\\circ n}(x)$ is reducible. In this paper we prove that there are infinitely many irreducible cubics $f \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ with $f\\circ f$ reducible by exhibiting a one parameter family with this property."
