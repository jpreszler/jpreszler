# Biography

I am an Assistant Professor of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science at The College of Idaho. My research interests are in the application of statistics and machine learning to problems in algebraic number theory as well as other applications of machine learning and Bayesian modeling, depending on collaborators and other interesting things that pass my way.

Currently, my main focus is on using machine learning to better understand why some irreducible polynomials factor after being composed with themselves. There are infinitely many polynomials with this property, but only about 1 in a million randomly selected polynomials will do this. 

I regularly teach a wide variety of courses including Introductory Statistics, Introductory Computer Science, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, Applied Databases, Geometry and Number Theory and have taught almost every undergraduate math course. I also enjoy working with students on independent study and research projects, so if you're interested in what I do or have a project that involves analyzing data please come see me.
