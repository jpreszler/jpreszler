This course invites you--as you begin your own liberal arts education--to explore through literature, art history, and other forms of thought what it has meant to be an individual. We will explore the notions of famous historical figures, as well as those of contemporary thinkers, and we will consider the many ways in which we cultivate our selfhood--intellectually, to be sure, but also physically, spiritually, and in relation to others.

This course invites you--as you begin your own liberal arts education--to explore through literature, art history, and other forms of thought what it has meant to be an individual. We will explore the notions of famous historical figures, as well as those of contemporary thinkers, and we will consider the many ways in which we cultivate our selfhood--intellectually, to be sure, but also physically, spiritually, and in relation to others.
