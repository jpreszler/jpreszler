    abstract = { AbstractA polynomial f (x) has emergent reducibility at depth n if f◦k (x) is irreducible for 0 ≤ k ≤ n − 1 but f◦n(x) is reducible. In this paper we prove that there are infinitely many irreducible cubics f ∈ [x] with f ◦f reducible by exhibiting a one parameter family with this property. }
