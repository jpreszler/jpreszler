      <description>Edit 7/27/2018 I realized that MFL’s name change to WLC didn’t change the prefix of their courses, this broke my scrapper. Below is an updated post that deals with this.
Back in early May, I wrote a post about scraping the College of Idaho catalog: Counting Classes. Below if the same post (boring…) except that the “current catalog” has been updated. This is really a demonstration of reproducibility, the upstream data has changed and ideally all my code still works.</description>

      <description>At the College of Idaho, there’s been discussion about visualizing the curriculum as well as understanding the curriculum. Naturally this interests me as a chance to wallow in some complicated data (students are required to complete a major and 3 minors across 4 “peaks” rather than complete courses from a traditional “core”). I thought using R and a Neo4j graph database would be useful (something to look forward to) - but first I needed to get data from the catalogue!</description>
