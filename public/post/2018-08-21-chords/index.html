<p>The point of this post is to illustrate how to make the above “chord diagram” using the <code>chorddiag</code> package which leverages D3.js from R. The above visual shows students major/minor combinations who graduated in 2017 from the College of Idaho with at least one minor connected to my department: MAPS. Lower case abbreviations are minors, upper case are majors. Be sure to hover over chords, sectors, or labels to get the full D3.js effect. Also each major can be up to triple counted since students typically earn a major and 3 minors and we’re only plotting the pairings.</p>
<div id="getting-ready" class="section level2">
<h2>Getting Ready</h2>
<p>To do this, we’ll need several common packages:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr) #pipes, mutate, select
library(tidyr) #gather
library(stringr) #string processing
library(RColorBrewer) #Colors!!</code></pre>
<p>We’ll also need the excellent <a href="https://github.com/mattflor/chorddiag">chorddiag</a> package, available via github:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#install if needed
devtools::install_github(&quot;mattflor/chorddiag&quot;)
#definitely load
library(chorddiag)</code></pre>
<p>Of course, we’ll also need some data, I’ll be using a data set of “anonymized” records of students major/minors degree info from the College of Idaho, which I had in another project: <a href="https://github.com/jpreszler/peak-neo4j/blob/master/misc/maps-minor-historical-cleaned.csv">data</a>. I’ve read it in with <code>read.csv()</code> and dropped 2 columns:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(mmh) %&gt;% knitr::kable()</code></pre>

<p>Since students at C of I get a major and 3 minors (in place of a set general education core), we’ll have to reshape this and clean it up a bit.</p>
</div>
<div id="reshape-and-first-plot" class="section level2">
<h2>Reshape and First Plot</h2>
<p>We want to just look at major/minor pairs, so we’re going to gather the minors together, change case and trim spaces:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mmhl &lt;- gather(mmh, key=mNum, value = minor, 
               -c(Grad.Year, Major1, Degree)) %&gt;%

  mutate(minor = str_to_lower(str_trim(minor, side = &quot;both&quot;))) %&gt;%
  rename(MAJOR = Major1)

<p>Let’s try a plot to see how it looks. Chord diagrams need a matrix or contingency table though, so we make that and then plot.</p>

<p>The <code>type="bipartite"</code> allows us to pass a non-square matrix to <code>chorddiag</code> since we only need links between two sets of groups (majors and minors). This isn’t bad, but the default color options only allow about 16 groups (8 from the <code>dark2</code> palette and 8 form the <code>grey2</code> palette). Also the tick marks seem unnecessary.</p>
</div>
<div id="improving-colors" class="section level2">
<h2>Improving Colors</h2>
<p>Removing the tick marks is easy (set option <code>showTicks=FALSE</code>), but coming up with lots of colors is a bit harder. The table has dimensions 8, 20, so we would 28 colors, and this isn’t even all possible combinations that C of I students have obtained!</p>
<p>To get a large list of relatively distinct colors, we can do this by squishing the “qualitative” colors palettes from color brewer together. This gives 74 colors with only a little repetition:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>qual_cols = brewer.pal.info[brewer.pal.info$category == &#39;qual&#39;,]
many_colors = unlist(mapply(brewer.pal, qual_cols$maxcolors, rownames(qual_cols)))</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>many_colors</code> has a large color palette for us to make our plot:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>chorddiag(
  xtabs(~MAJOR+minor, data = mmhl[mmhl$Grad.Year == 2017,],
        drop.unused.levels = TRUE),
  showTicks = FALSE, groupColors = many_colors, type = &quot;bipartite&quot;
)</code></pre>
