    This post is about a type of visualization the will hopefully help see how students “flow” through college. The data is an anonymized selection of Math and Math-Computer Science majors at the College of Idaho, and for simplicity we’ll only be using the math and computer science courses. Out goal is to produce the following Sankey Diagram, which is really just a graph (in the discrete math sense - nodes connected by edges) where the edges are scaled by weight, in this case the number of students taking course A then B will be reflected in the width of the link between A and B.

    This post is primarily to give the basic overview of principal components analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and regression. I wanted to create it as a guide for my regression students who may find it useful for their projects. First, let’s note the two main times that you may want to use PCA - dimensionality reduction (reducing variables in a dataset) and removing colinearity issues. These are not exclusive problems, often you want to do both.

    Clearly, there’s no such thing as a “reticulated mixture model” but if you create one I’ll gladly take credit for the name. Instead this post is a demonstration of using mixture models for clustering and the interplay of R and Python via RStudio’s reticulate package.
Mixture Model Basics The idea behind mixture models is that you have data containing information from two (or more) subgroups and you want to uncover structure of the subgroups.

    One of the classic assumptions of the linear regression models is that, conditioned on the explanatory variables, the response variable should be normally distributed. While teaching this the other day, I had a flash of insight into how to visualize this - ridge-line plots!
Data I’ve been using Matloff’s Statistical Regression and Classification book, which uses the mlb dataset from his freqparcoord package. This has data on heights, weights, ages, positions, and teams of over 1000 major league baseball players.

    I’ve been using R since 2006. That predates RStudio and the tidyverse. I remember the struggle of keeping track of the variants of apply and often fiddling with them to get code to work.
Then came plyr and the dplyr and my life has never been the same. The major verbs of dplyr include select, filter, mutate, group_by, summarise, and arrange; and if you are doing data analysis in R then you should be fluent in them.

    Recently I’ve posted about the College of Idaho’s 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 course distribution. The second post showed how easy it was to reproduce everything, which was good because a colleague recently asked about the total number of courses in 2016-2017 for a funded grant related to curriculum review. These total numbers of courses of courses made me wonder about how the catalog has evolved over the last few years?

    Edit 7/27/2018 I realized that MFL’s name change to WLC didn’t change the prefix of their courses, this broke my scrapper. Below is an updated post that deals with this.
Back in early May, I wrote a post about scraping the College of Idaho catalog: Counting Classes. Below if the same post (boring…) except that the “current catalog” has been updated. This is really a demonstration of reproducibility, the upstream data has changed and ideally all my code still works.

    In RMarkdown documents I often have a need to display tables, which I usually try to keep small with only the most useful information displayed. However, a recent project made me look for a better way to share tabular data with non-data-scientists. The answer was R’s DT package, which allows for very powerful displays of tabular data.
Today’s data will be a summary of enrollment data from the College of Idaho:

    UPDATE (6/20/2018) The cypher query for Table 3 only used components with “optional” courses so the capstone and topics compnents of the Math/CS major weren’t included in table 3.
UPDATE (6/19/2018) The original version of this post used incorrectly loaded data that caused to “Core” of every major to have the same classes attached to it. This was noticed by my colleague Dave Rosoff and has been corrected.
