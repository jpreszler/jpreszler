    Introduction Recently a student in another course came to my office looking for someone “who could explain the Monte Carlo simulation” to her. I was caught a bit off-guard since (a) it was 10 minutes before my geometry class and (b) there is no single Monte Carlo simulation.
After a brief discussion, I found out she wanted to predict stock prices using Monte Carlo simulation, but she thought that the Monte Carlo simulation provided the prediction - she couldn’t say how the actual predictions were being made which is the crucial part.

    This is the second part of two posts about using ggplot to visualize geometric transformations in the complex plane.
Inversions For this post we’ll focus on inversions, having already covered rotations, translations, and reflections. An inversion can be thought of as a reflection across a circle, the the inside of the circle gets flipped to fill the plane outside the circle and the outside is flipped into the circle. This is a more complicated transformation, both to visualize and to perform mathematically, but is essential to geometry.

    I’m currently teaching a Geometry course, and wished there was an easy way to illustrate geometric transformations for my students. I’m sure they’ll agree I’m not a great artist.
Since R is my preferred way to draw any picture, I thought “Let’s use GGPlot to show transformations!”
For those not versed in geometry, we would like to easily visualize translations (shifts along a vector), rotations, and dilations of points (or collections of points) in the complex plane.

    Besides lots of family time and the creation of this blog/website, this is what I’ve been thinking about over the winter break.
Background As part of my research in emergent reducibility, I’ve had to face a binary classification situation with severe class imbalance. Among brute-force searches, it seems that there’s roughly 1 case of emergent reducibility (what I’m looking for) for every 1 million irreducible cubic polynomials. It is known that there are infinitely many cubic polynomials with emergent reducibility.
