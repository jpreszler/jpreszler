      <description>Besides lots of family time and the creation of this blog/website, this is what I’ve been thinking about over the winter break.
Background As part of my research in emergent reducibility, I’ve had to face a binary classification situation with severe class imbalance. Among brute-force searches, it seems that there’s roughly 1 case of emergent reducibility (what I’m looking for) for every 1 million irreducible cubic polynomials. It is known that there are infinitely many cubic polynomials with emergent reducibility.</description>
